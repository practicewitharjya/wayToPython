Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7,
between 1000 and 1800 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method
range(1000,1801)



Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 1000 and 1800 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method




Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.




Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']


Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.You have to use split function to separate by comma.
